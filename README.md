# Salmon Cookies using Vue.js

## Authors: Justin Mathieu and Tricia Sawyer

## Project

The goal of this project was to reimagine our previous Salmon Cookies application using Vue.js, a modern JavaScript framework that we self-taught.

Vue.js gained significant popularity by 2021, known for its simplicity, ease of integration, and well-thought-out framework design. At that time, it boasted a thriving community with numerous developers using it to create a variety of web applications.

### Vue.js

As of 2021, Vue.js was renowned for its:

- Simplicity: Vue.js made complex web development tasks more approachable and less daunting.
- Ease of Integration: It seamlessly integrated with existing projects, making it a practical choice for enhancing our Salmon Cookies application.
- Strong Community: Vue.js had a rapidly growing and supportive community, providing valuable resources and assistance.

#### Pros

- Flexibility

- Testing was a struggle

- The documentation was helpful, but the concepts weren't explained as in depth as we would've liked so had to find that elsewhere
